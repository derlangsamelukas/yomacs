* yomacs
my emacs configuration

** Todo's
   + [ ] prefix all miscellaneous functions with yo-
   + [ ] when in the middle of a word: backend yo-js-company-backend error "Wrong type argument: stringp, nil" with args (prefix)
   + [ ] autopair not working correctly in rjsx-mode
   + [ ] cannot choose package when multiple symbols with the same name are exported from different packages
   + [ ] unneccessary adding of import when autocompleting (maybe add backend to the end of the list or lower priority)
   + [ ] yo-js-project-rehash, dont close rjsx buffer if it is the current one (close if file was not opened yet)
